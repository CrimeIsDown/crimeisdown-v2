        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>The purpose of CrimeIsDown.com is to provide police scanner listeners in the Chicago area an easy way to lookup information quickly pertaining to what they hear. Journalists use the site to quickly know what neighborhood and police district an incident is happening in. Scanner enthusiasts use the site to find out what radio zone they should listen to. Average citizens use the site to find out what crime is happening around them and to tune in live.</p>
        <p>We hope to let people decide for themselves whether or not crime is down, based on independent statistics and listening to breaking news.</p>
